        Writing the destination and then removing the source destroys the file whenever the two
        paths are one file on disk, which is what a case-only rename is on a filesystem that
        folds case. Removing the source first destroys it whenever the replacement write fails.

        So neither path is written or removed until the new content is committed somewhere else:
        the text goes to a staging file, a single `mv` puts it at the destination, and only then
        is the source removed, and only if the filesystem says it is a different entry. Before
        that `mv` the original is untouched; after it the new content exists. There is no moment
        where the only copy is in memory, and nothing is restored after the fact, so a file that
        another writer creates at the source path while this runs is never overwritten.

        It can still be removed. The identity answer is read before the removal, and the removal
        names a path rather than the entry that answer was about, so a writer that replaces the
        source between the two loses the file it just wrote. Closing that needs a removal that
        can be told which entry it is allowed to remove, which no backend here offers.

        The staging file is a new inode, so a rename the filesystem folds onto the source path
        replaces the original's mode and extended attributes. Carrying those across would mean
        reading and reapplying them per backend; committing the content in a single `mv` is
        worth more than the mode bits.

        The staging name is a fixed length rather than a decoration of the destination name,
        because a destination basename near the filesystem's 255-byte limit would make the
        decorated name exceed it and the write would fail with ENAMETOOLONG.
